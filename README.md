# Sarkin Noma AI Data Crowdsourcing

**Welcome to Sarkin Noma AI's Data Crowdsourcing Repository!**

This repository serves as an open data initiative to gather, validate, and curate critical agricultural data for the **Sarkin Noma AI** project. Sarkin Noma AI is a suite of machine learning models designed to address food insecurity in Northern Nigeria by empowering farmers with real-time, data-driven insights on crop suitability, climate conditions, soil characteristics, and more.

## Project Overview

Sarkin Noma AI helps farmers make informed decisions by:
- Assessing crop suitability based on location, season, and weather
- Recommending optimal farming practices using real-time data
- Providing insights on market trends, disease risks, and preventive measures

This repository focuses on crowdsourcing data to enhance the predictive accuracy and reach of Sarkin Noma AI. By contributing data, you help support an ecosystem of accessible, accurate agricultural intelligence.

## How You Can Contribute

We welcome contributions from farmers, agronomists, researchers, and tech enthusiasts. Hereâ€™s how you can get involved:

1. **Add New Data**: Submit datasets related to climate, soil texture, crop types, market prices, and disease pressures in various regions.
2. **Data Validation**: Review and validate data to ensure quality and accuracy.
3. **Improve Data Formats**: Suggest and implement improved ways to structure and annotate data for better compatibility with our models.

## Data Requirements
